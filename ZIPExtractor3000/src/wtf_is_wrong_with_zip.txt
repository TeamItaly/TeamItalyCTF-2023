Section 4.3.1 says
```
A ZIP file MUST have only one "end of central directory record".
```
but it's rarely enforced.


Section 8.3.3 semms to imply that the central directory should be at the end of the file (it talks about the splitting of files, but I think it's principles can be applied to a single file).

Nearly every ZIP file reader reads from the end, 7-zip reads from the beginning...
