I introduce to you Borraccia!

Borraccia is a minimal web framework which puts security first. Are you asking how he does it? Well, by removing (almost) all the features that I consider useless.
Obviously it's written in Python, so it's 100% safe!

**Note:** You are limited to 60 requests per minute. It's recommended to test it locally first.
