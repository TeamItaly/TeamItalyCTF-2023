Say hi to the Modern Sicilian Network (MSN), the new exclusive social network for sicilians, made by a sicilian.
Having taken inspiration from an old-but-gold social network in both looks and security, the MSN is set to become the future of communications in the whole island.
How secure is it though?

Will you be able to steal the flag from the chat between admin Loldemort and cat Tofu?

Flag format: `flag{[0-9A-Z]+}`
